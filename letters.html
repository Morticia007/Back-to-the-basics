          Love and perfection are two different things.<br />
          Love is real.<br />
          Finding someone who will drive you crazy,<br />
          but still make your life wonderful— <br />that’s real.<br />
          Learning someone’s inner fears, <br />
          discovering what makes them laugh,<br />
          finally working up the courage to kiss them— <br />that’s real.<br />

            <bold>To my Husband</bold>,
            <p>
                My life would not be the same without you. You often say that I have saved your life, but in reality you have saved mine.

                This is why I have begun writing you a series of

            <h3>
                My love for you grows everyday, and there are a few things that I find very humorous
            </h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    First
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                             The adorable fact that you think your farts make me laugh (they just make you laugh - which by default makes me laugh. So if you think about, it they do eventually make me laugh).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                             The silly songs you sing (I really do love those, no matter how wierd they are sometimes).
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Second
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                             The hilarious poop comments you would hide in my code when I was in that bootcamp.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                             The way you go about trying to make sure I laugh everyday, no matter how I'm feeling.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
